This is a simple Django application I created to keep track of Blu-ray discs
and such owned among my group of friends so we can coordinate purchases and
know whom to ask to borrow things.  It assumes that things like users and media
types are configured either in a JSON file to be imported or directly in the
database or admin interface.  If I have time, I'll come back to it to add a
few features and make it a little more admin-friendly.
